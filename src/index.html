      <h1>Mount Fuji</h1>
      <a href="https://www.planetware.com/japan/mount-fuji-jpn-kn-fuji.htm" target="_blank"><img
          src="../src/media/mount_fuji.jpg" alt="Mount Fuji"></a>
      <br>
      <p>Without a doubt Japan's most recognizable landmark, majestic Mount Fuji (Fuji-san) is also the country's
        highest
        mountain peak. Towering 3,776 meters over an otherwise largely flat landscape to the south and east, this
        majestic
        and fabled mountain is tall enough to be seen from Tokyo, more than 100 kilometers away.</p>
      <p>Mount Fuji has for centuries been celebrated in art and literature and is now considered so important an
        icon
        that
        UNESCO recognized its world cultural significance in 2013. Part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, Mount
        Fuji
        is
        climbed by more than a million people each summer as an act of pilgrimage, which culminates in watching the
        sunrise
        from its summit.</p>
      <p>While some still choose to begin their climb from the base, the majority of climbers now start from above
        the
        halfway mark, at the 5th Station, resulting in a more manageable six-or-so-hour ascent. Those who do attempt
        the
        complete climb are advised to depart in the afternoon, breaking up the climb with an overnight stop at one
        of
        the
        "Mountain Huts" designed for this very purpose. An early start the next day gets you to the top for the
        sunrise.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, for many, simply viewing the mountain from the distance, or from the comfort of a speeding
        train,
        is
        enough to say "been there, done that."</p>

      <h1>Historic Kyoto</h1>

          src="../src/media/historic_kyoto.jpg" alt="Historic Kyoto"></a>
      <p>One of Japan's most visited cities, lovely Kyoto : one of the few cities in the country to be spared the
        devastation of WWII : attracts more than 10 million visitors annually. Most of them are here to explore
        Kyoto's
        fine
        old streets anist-influenced architecture include its many well-preserved temples, 30 of which are
        still in use, and important structures such as the 14th-century Golden Pavilion (Kinkaku-ji), famous for its
        exquisite gold-leaf-clad exterior.</p>

      <p>Be sure to also visit Nijo Castle, a 17th-century fortress that has retained its original walls, towers,
        and
        moat.
        Also worth seeing are the castle's beautiful gates, along with its palace with fine interior décor.</p>
      <p>Another landmark to visit is the original Kyoto Imperial Palace (Kyoto-gosho). Built in AD 794, it's one of
        the
        city's most visited historic sites.</p>
      <p>Finally, no visit to Kyoto is complete without spending time exploring the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove. This
        beautiful
        area of tall bamboo is just a few minutes' walk from the town center.</p>

      <h1>Osaka Castle</h1>
      <a href="https://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions-/osaka-jpn-ks-o.htm" target="_blank"><img
          src="../src/media/osaka_castle.jpg" alt="Osaka Castle"></a>
      <p>Built in 1586 by famous Japanese warrior and politician Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Osaka Castle (Ōsaka-jō) was at
        the
        time
        the largest and most important fortress in the country. Although destroyed and rebuilt a number of times
        since,
        the
        present structure, built in 1931, remains true to the original.</p>
      <p>Highlights of a visit include the huge five-story, 42-meter-tall main tower. Built on an imposing
        14-meter-tall
        stone base, the tower is home to a number of displays detailing the history of the castle and the city. Be
        sure
        to
        visit the top floor for its superb views over Osaka, an especially attractive sight as the sun sets.</p>
      <p>Also of interest in Osaka Castle Park is the Hokoku Shrine, while Osaka's best-known temple, Shitennō-ji,
        is
        also
        worth visiting and dates back to AD 59. Notable as Japan's first Buddhist temple, this lovely shrine
        features
        a
        five-story pagoda along with a number of other exquisitely decorated buildings. Among them are the Golden
        Pavilion
        (Kondō), with its fine statues and paintings; the Lecture Hall (Kōdō); and a lovely covered corridor linking
        three
        of the site's gates.</p>

      <h1>Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine</h1>
      <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3915.html" target="_blank"><img
          src="../src/media/fushimi_inari_taisha_shrine.jpg" alt="Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine"></a>
      <p>When you visit Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine, you'll be seeing red : but in a beautiful way. One of the most
        important shrines in Japan, the Fushimi Inari shrine is found in southern Kyoto, made famous for the
        thousands
        (yes,
        thousands) of scarlet-colored gates that arch over a web of trails. These arch-covered trails command
        silence,
        so
        expect a very peaceful walk towards the forest around Mt. Inari.</p>
      <p>Inari is the Shinto god of rice : one of the most important gods in Shintoism. Of the thousands of shrines
        dedicated
        to him, Fushimi Inari is decidedly the most important. Most travelers come to see the vermilion gates, but
        the
        shrine itself is also open for exploration, and the buildings are quite spectacular.</p>
      <p>Visitors can also hike to the top of Mt. Inari, which takes roughly two to three hours round-trip. The
        route
        up
        the
        mountain is dotted with shrines and smaller gates, as well as spots to grab something to eat.</p>

      <h1>Arashiyma Monkey Park</h1>
      <a href="https://www.insidekyoto.com/arashiyama-monkey-park" target="_blank"><img
          src="../src/media/arashiyama_monkey_park.jpg" alt="Arashiyama Monkey Park"></a>
      <p>Located in the Arishayama section of Kyoto, the famous Arashiayama Monkey Park is one of the best things to
        do
        both
        in Kyoto, as well as Japan overall. A short hike up a forest-covered mountain opens up to sweeping views
        over
        the
        city, as well as a troop of more than 120 Japanese macaque monkeys.</p>
      <p>The macaques roam freely in the monkey park, allowing visitors to get up close and personal with these
        energetic
        creatures. You can even feed them with food you purchase at the park. You'll find a small, wooden enclosure
        where
        you can feed the monkeys. Outside the enclosure the macaques roam freely, bouncing from branch to branch and
        scattering across the dirt trails.</p>
      <p>The top of the peak also provides a great view of Kyoto and the beautiful mountain peaks in the distance.
        Visiting
        the monkey park is wonderful in both spring and fall because you'll have a bird's eye view of the cherry
        blossoms
        and the brilliant changing of the leaves.</p>
